# How to run this code?

Package: Qiskit

The function of files:

- base:

  - encoding.py: use in the integrated swap test (isc) circuit.

  - swaptest.py: create and run isc circuit.

  - knn.py: do the classical task in the origin kNN

- jupyter:

  - qknn.ipynb: call functions from knn.py and swaptest.py, load dataset Iris and excute method predict().

  - knn.ipynb: run kNN classifier that provided from sklearn.
